Annotated Bookmarks for Software Engineering
============================================
I am having a renew interest in software engineering due to my involvement in teaching/coordinating of CS3281/2 as well as my desire to push the quality of research software from my research group.

As such, I am collecting a series of related articles from online resources that could be useful for students.  This reposotiry keeps track of this effort.

For a start, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/weitsang/software-engineering/wiki) for a collection of (to be annotated) links.
